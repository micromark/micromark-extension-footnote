# micromark-extension-footnote

Deprecated: this package is no longer maintained.
Please use [`micromark-extension-gfm-footnote`][gfm-footnote]
(or [`micromark-extension-gfm`][gfm],
which bundles includes it and all of GFM)
instead.
Those packages match how footnotes work on github.com,
which is more likely to match the expectations of your authors.

[Git][] is still intact and previous versions can still be used without warnings.
